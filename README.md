# HIGHTECH BACKEND TEST SUBMISSION

## Modular Monolithic Architecture Version

---

## Introduction

In this approach, I decided to structure the backend using modular monolithic architecture, where all key features are modularized.
This Aids subsequent scaling when there is a need to migrate to microservice architecture.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git@github.com:Joepolymath/hightech-assessment-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd hightech-assessment-backend
   ```

3. Install all dependencies using your preferred package manager. For example, using `pnpm`:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`. This file contains environment variables used by the application:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Usage

To run the server in dev mode, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command starts the server and provides the necessary endpoints for accessing the application.
